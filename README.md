## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD candidate in astrophysics at the University of Chicago. My research works toward understanding how galaxies form and evolve with a specific focus on the chemical and physical mechanisms that regulate star formation in the smallest galaxies. 

See below for some selected GitHub repos which I own/maintain or to which I have contributed.

ðŸ”­ I am invested in open science, so I try to make my code/data/models public:
- [avapolzin/CHIMExIllustrisTNG](https://github.com/avapolzin/CHIMExIllustrisTNG)
- [avapolzin/hydrogen_models](https://github.com/avapolzin/hydrogen_models)
- [avapolzin/X-rayLCs](https://github.com/avapolzin/X-rayLCs)

ðŸ”­ I also work on scientific software projects that I hope will be useful to the community:
- [tbmiller-astro/silkscreen](https://github.com/tbmiller-astro/silkscreen)
- [avapolzin/spike](https://github.com/avapolzin/spike)

âœ¨ and sometimes I publish smaller packages for fun (or as relatively simple utilities):
- [avapolzin/albumpl](https://github.com/avapolzin/albumpl)
- [avapolzin/cutout](https://github.com/avapolzin/cutout)
- [avapolzin/rahrah](https://github.com/avapolzin/rahrah)

ðŸ“š Additionally, I'm very active in instruction and pedagogy, and share some materials on GitHub:
- [astroteaching/astroteaching.github.io](https://github.com/astroteaching/astroteaching.github.io)
- [avapolzin/ASTR255_Fall2021](https://github.com/avapolzin/ASTR255_Fall2021)
